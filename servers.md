ping server to check
ssh root@ip-adderress
login and change password
check ufw firewall status
allow some  rules like http, https, ssh using sudo ufw allow <rules>
enable firefall using sudo ufw enable and you can disable it using ufw disable

we can then install whatever we wanna install on the server.
Clone our project from github, link it to a subdomain and do whatever we have been doing before
